Simple Scientific Calculator - BETA version

Just a scientific calculator for everyday use, nothing less nothing more

From the beginning I tried to keep the app simple and kept the main focus on functionality, and less so
on fancy details. This calculator have the basic four functions, also including more advanced funtions 
like square and cube, with square roots and cube roots, the calculator also includes trignometric 
functions sin, cos, tan also including their inverses arcsin, arccos, arctan, and to top it of the 
calculator can also handle log, natural log, and euler's number.
